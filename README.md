## Important Notes:

1. **Android SDK Requirement**:  
   This application has a minimum Android SDK requirement of Android 12. Devices running versions lower than this may not be able to run the app. The limitation arises from a known compatibility issue with the Splash Screen API. While I am actively working on a fix, this note likely means the issue is still unresolved. (Yes, I know â€” still a work in progress! ðŸ˜…)

2. **API Hosting on Free Tier**:  
   The REST API for this project is hosted on Render's free tier, which means the server instance may enter a "spin-down" state when idle. This can temporarily affect the app's ability to fetch products or process orders. To resolve this, simply visit the API documentation at [Swagger](https://smatech-pos-api.onrender.com/smatech_api/swagger-ui/index.html). Accessing the link should wake up the instance, allowing the app to function normally again.

3. **REST API Documentation**:  
   As part of the assignment requirements, I was tasked with showcasing the API requests and responses. The documentation linked above provides detailed information on all REST API endpoints, including their requests and responses.
